# mario-gamemaker
An attempt at re-creating Super Mario Bros. World 1-1 in GameMaker for learning purposes.

I made this back in 2015, seemed a shame to delete it, so I finally uploaded it here in the year of our lord and saviour 2025.<br/>
I couldn't be bothered downloading whatever ancient version of gamemaker this used to compile the exe, Sorry!<br/>
I remember the physics being very far from the original game, but was otherwise identical.
